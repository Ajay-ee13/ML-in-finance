## Machine Learning Applications in Finance
- ** Algorithmic Trading **
- ** Portfolio Management and Robo-Advisors **
- ** Fraud Detection **
- ** Loans/Credit Card/Insurance Underwriting **
- ** Automation and Chatbots **
- ** Risk Management **
- ** Asset Price Prediction **
- ** Derivative Pricing ** : The classic derivative pricing models like Black-Scholes models, volatility smiles model, are built on several impractical assumptions to
  reproduce the empirical relationship between the underlying input data (strike price, time to maturity, option type) and the price of the derivatives observed in the
  market. Machine learning methods do not rely on several assumptions; they just try to estimate a function between the input data and price, minimizing the difference
  between the results of the model and the target. The faster deployment times achieved with state-of-the-art ML tools are one of the advantages that will
  accelerate the use of machine learning in derivatives pricing.
- ** Sentiment Analysis ** : The most common use of sentiment analysis in the financial sector is the analysis of financial news in particular, predicting the behaviors 
  and possible trends of markets. The stock market moves in response to myriad human-related factors, and the hope is that machine learning will be able to replicate and
  enhance human intuition about financial activity by discovering new trends and telling signals.
- ** Trade Settlement ** : Trade settlement is the process of transferring securities into the account of a buyer and cash into the seller's account following a 
  transaction of a financial asset. Here Machine learning can be used to identify the reason for failed trades, and can also analyze why the trades were rejected, 
  provide a solution, and predict which trades may fail in the future.
- ** Money Laundering **: We can use Machine learning techniques to analyze internal, publicly existing, and transactional data from a client's broader network in an
  attempt to spot money laundering signs.
