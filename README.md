## Machine Learning Applications in Finance
- **Algorithmic Trading**
- **Portfolio Management and Robo-Advisors** : Machine learnig algorithims can be used for improving investment decisions and making use of historical data.
- **Fraud Detection**
- **Loans/Credit Card/Insurance Underwriting** : At large companies (big banks and publicly traded insurance firms), machine learning algorithms can be trained on   
  millions of examples of consumer data and financial lending or insurance outcomes, such as whether a person defaulted on their loan or mortgage.
  Underlying financial trends can be assessed with algorithms and continuously analyzed to detect trends that might influence lending and underwriting risk in the
  future. Algorithms can perform automated tasks such as matching data records, identifying exceptions, and calculating whether an applicant qualifies for a credit or
  insurance product.
- **Automation and Chatbots** : Adding machine learning and AI into the automation adds another level of support for employees. With access to relevant data, 
  machine learning and AI can provide an in-depth data analysis to support finance teams with difficult decisions. In some cases, it may even be able to recommend the  
  best course of action for employees to approve and enact.
  AI and automation in the financial sector can also learn to recognize errors, reducing the time wasted between discovery and resolution. With this human team
  members are less likely to be delayed in providing their reports and are able to complete their work with fewer errors.
- **Risk Management** : Machine learning techniques are transforming how we approach risk management. All aspects of understanding and controlling risk are being 
  revolutionized through the growth of solutions driven by machine learning. Examples range from deciding how much a bank should lend a customer to improving compliance 
  and reducing model risk.
- **Asset Price Prediction** : Asset price prediction is considered the most frequently discussed and most sophisticated area in finance. Predicting asset prices allows 
  one to understand the factors that drive the market and speculate asset performance. With the availability of large amount of financial data, the traditional 
  approaches for analysis and stock-selection strategies can be supplemented with ML-based techniques.
- **Derivative Pricing** : The classic derivative pricing models like Black-Scholes models, volatility smiles model, are built on several impractical assumptions to
  reproduce the empirical relationship between the underlying input data (strike price, time to maturity, option type) and the price of the derivatives observed in the
  market. Machine learning methods do not rely on several assumptions; they just try to estimate a function between the input data and price, minimizing the difference
  between the results of the model and the target. The faster deployment times achieved with state-of-the-art ML tools are one of the advantages that will
  accelerate the use of machine learning in derivatives pricing.
- **Sentiment Analysis** : The most common use of sentiment analysis in the financial sector is the analysis of financial news in particular, predicting the behaviors 
  and possible trends of markets. The stock market moves in response to myriad human-related factors, and the hope is that machine learning will be able to replicate and
  enhance human intuition about financial activity by discovering new trends and telling signals.
- **Trade Settlement** : Trade settlement is the process of transferring securities into the account of a buyer and cash into the seller's account following a 
  transaction of a financial asset. Here Machine learning can be used to identify the reason for failed trades, and can also analyze why the trades were rejected, 
  provide a solution, and predict which trades may fail in the future.
- **Money Laundering**: We can use Machine learning techniques to analyze internal, publicly existing, and transactional data from a client's broader network in an
  attempt to spot money laundering signs.
